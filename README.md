# IN PROCCESS - DO NOT USE

Public Watch List

The information provided on this List is free to use. Most of the information on the list is (probably) highly subjective, contains mistakes, misspells, biased opinions and other BS. 

Under no circumstances, this information should be used as financial advice of any kind or in any similar way. It is strictly for informational and \ or educational purposes. 

The List contains a collection of interesting, open-source, blockchain projects that I believe are worth mentioning.

If you wish to make changes to the file, add or delete a project, or think that you can contribute in any other way - please feel free to submit a [PR](https://github.com/serejandmyself/Public-Watch-List/pulls).

A note to contributors: please be aware that the list is intended for the broader public wishing to get a general "hang" around good crypto projects. Hence, I am specifically avoiding indexes that are based on deep technological understanding (i.e. hash rate, difficulty etc) or that require strong economical background (ratios, buying percentages etc) (inflation and deflation indexes are a subject for strong subjective discussion). 

P.S. I would appreciate it if you link to this repo in case you decide to copy any information or use it for any purposes that you might want to. I would highly appreciate it, if you star this repository.
