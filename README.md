# Public-Watch-List

Dear Reader,

The information provided in this file is free to use. Please be advised that all the information in this file is highly subjective. Could (and probably does) contain mistakes, misspellings, biased opinions (I do hold some of these assets in my private portfolio) and other errors. 

Under no circumstances, this information should be used as financial advise of any kind or in any similar way. It should strictly, be used, for informational and \ or educational purposes only.

If you do not agree with the information provided.Or you wish to make changes to the file, add or delete information, or you think that you can contribute in any other way - please feel free to leave comments in the appropriate repository on GitHub.

A note to contributors: please be aware that the list is intended for the broader public wishing to get a general hang around good crypro projects. Hence, I am specifically avoiding indexes that are based on deep technological understanding (i.e. hashrate, difficulty etc) or that require strong economical background (ratios, buying percentages etc) (inflation and deflation indexes are a subject for strong subjective discussion). 

Saying that, if you believe that certain indexes should be included on the list, feel free to attach your arguments for it.
